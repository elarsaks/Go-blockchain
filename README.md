This project is a Docker-based blockchain application that is currently under development. It is written in Golang and features a user interface built in React. The application is composed of several key components, each serving a unique role in the overall functionality of the system.

## Components

- **Client UI (React Dashboard):** The client user interface is a visual dashboard built using React. This dashboard serves as the primary point of interaction for users with the blockchain. It provides a user-friendly interface for executing various operations on the blockchain.

- **API Gateway (Wallet Server):** The API Gateway, also known as the Wallet Server, is a web server developed in Golang. It acts as a bridge between the client UI and the blockchain, managing requests from the client and forwarding them to the appropriate APIs.

- **Blockchain Miner Nodes (Golang APIs):** The backbone of the blockchain is formed by three Golang APIs that function as blockchain miner nodes. These nodes are responsible for performing mining operations and maintaining the integrity of the blockchain.


## Workflow

Users can access the client UI to interact with the blockchain. The API gateway processes these interactions and communicates with the blockchain miner nodes. These nodes then process transactions and maintain the distributed ledger of the blockchain.

The Docker configuration of this application ensures easy deployment and scalability, making it a robust and flexible solution for blockchain applications.

## Project Goals

This project serves two main purposes:

1. **Skill Development:** It provides an excellent opportunity to push the boundaries of my technical skills and deepen my understanding of Blockchain technology.

2. **Community Resource:** I'm dedicated to creating a robust codebase that can serve as a valuable learning resource for anyone interested in this technology.


**The Docker configuration ensures easy deployment and scalability of the blockchain application.**
