# REACT DASHBOARD

## About
This is a user interface (UI) built with React. It features two wallets and a table displaying the last 10 blocks and their transactions. One wallet belongs to the miner, while the other belongs to a random user on the blockchain. The purpose of this UI is to illustrate how the blockchain works by allowing users to send "crypto" from the miner's wallet to the user's wallet, and vice versa.

Key Features:
- React UI: The interface is built using React, providing a modern and interactive user experience.
- Dual Wallets: The UI showcases two wallets, one belonging to the miner and the other to a user on the blockchain.
- Block and Transaction Display: A table displays the details of the last 10 blocks, including their transactions.
- Transaction Simulation: Users can simulate cryptocurrency transfers between the miner and the user, demonstrating the functionality of the blockchain.

By utilizing this UI, users can gain a better understanding of blockchain concepts, such as wallets, blocks, transactions, and the flow of cryptocurrencies. It serves as a visual representation of how the blockchain operates and facilitates learning in an interactive manner.
